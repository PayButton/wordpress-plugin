== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=01. How does PayButton unlock content?=
Once a visitor completes an eCash payment, the plugin verifies the transaction via PayButton and instantly unlocks the protected content.

=02. Do users need to register?=
No ‚Äì PayButton‚Äôs no-signup approach uses session tracking and database entries to grant immediate access using the public key of the payer's wallet.

=03. Can I customize the appearance of the paywall?=
Absolutely, the admin dashboard allows you to modify button texts, pricing, color schemes, and more to match your theme.

=04. Will PayButton‚Äôs cookies break page caching?=
No. PayButton sets two HMAC-signed paybutton_user_wallet_address and paybutton_paid_content to track user wallet address and unlocked content. Cookies only get updated (and send a Set-Cookie header) when their value actually changes, so full-page caches (e.g. WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache) and server caches (Nginx, Varnish) remain valid.

== External services ==

- PayButton websocket
This plugin connects to the PayButton WebSocket, a service that monitors blockchain transactions. It is used to detect payments made to the PayButton/Widget address in real time. The plugin uses the provided address to establish a connection and begins listening for events emitted when new transactions are detected. This service is provided by PayButton: [terms of use](https://github.com/PayButton/paybutton-server/blob/master/TERMS.md), [privacy policy](https://github.com/PayButton/paybutton-server/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).

- PayButton API 
This plugin communicates with the PayButton API to fetch information about the address and its transactions. It provides data such as the transaction price and the address balance, which are used by the widget and the button. This service is also provided by PayButton: [terms of use](https://github.com/PayButton/paybutton-server/blob/master/TERMS.md), [privacy policy](https://github.com/PayButton/paybutton-server/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).

- SideShift.AI API
The integration uses the SideShift API to enable the button or widget to accept payments in a different currency than the one being received. This service is provided by SideShift.AI: [terms of use](https://sideshift.ai/legal).
